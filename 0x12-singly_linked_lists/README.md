# This directory contains work on the data structure : **Singly Linked List**

It is a very easy to learn and implement data structure as it has properties similar to that of the normal array or list.

Although traversing a singly linked list takes an O(n) time complexity, where n is the size of the nodes, we can see use cases in things like:
 - insertion of new elements
 - deleting a new element. 

The singly linked list implemented in C, basically uses a struct that contains the data to be stored as well as a pointer to the next item.
